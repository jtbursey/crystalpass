Characters

This expression generates a string of letters, digits, and symbols. The default set is:

    !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    0123456789

Arguments:

    length - The number of characters to generate. (i.e. length=2 would make '#@')

    set - The set of characters to use.

Remember to escape any of the special characters that you want to use in your set:
'\\', '\[', '\]', '\"'.

We recommend just using the default set as there are over 30 symbols to choose from.
