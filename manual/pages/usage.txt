Usage

    This page will cover the basics of using CrystalPass with some high-level examples.

Alright, you've probably already figured out how to open CrystalPass and the manual, so
let's dig into password generation!

CrystalPass operates by parsing the text-based pattern that you provide it. For those who
know, the pattern is roughly based on regular expressions. Each expression represents a
set of symbols (i.e. letters, digits, words, etc.) that will be randomly chosen from when
the password is generated. An example of a random word with a length between 4 and 6 is:

    \word[length=4-6]

Each expression type has its own page in the manual. Look around to see what you can use!

Of course, writing regular expressions isn't the easiest way to go about creating
passwords. To help with that, I have created a wizard. Simply open it up, select what
type of expression you want next, and then select your arguments. Put multiple
expressions back-to-back to create your pattern!

    \word[length=4-6]\symbol\digit[length=2]

Once you have settled on a pattern you like and is strong enough, press generate!

Between uses of CrystalPass, you should be able to save your pattern in plaintext, though
I have plans to encrypt it for you. If the entropy of the pattern is strong enough, an
attacker shouldn't be able to guess it even knowing the pattern.
