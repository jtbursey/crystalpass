Word

This expression chooses a random word based on word length.

Arguments:

    length - The length or lengths of the words to choose from.

    caps - Can be 'true' or 'false' to use random capitals, or 'begin' or 'end' to
           capitalize the first or last letter of the word.
    
    subs - Can be either 'true' or 'false' to use common ascii substitutions such as 'a'
           becoming '@'.

For the purpose of random, all words of the given lengths are put into a single list and
then chosen from at random.

Ascii substitutions happen before capitalizations.
