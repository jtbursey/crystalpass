Password Feedback - How to make strong passwords

    This page will introduce at a high level the feedback channels in CrystalPass, and
    how to use that feedback to make strong passwords.

CrystalPass's main feedback channel is through entropy analysis and binned strength. The
Entropy page explains in detail what entropy is, but at a high level, it is a measure of
how complex your password is. It is measured in 'bits', and a higher number is better.
The binned strength feedback tells you how strong your password is in words. I recommend
that you aim for a 'Strong' password.

Using CrystalPass, you will create a pattern from which the password will be generated.
Since the generation process is completely random following from the pattern, CrystalPass
is able to give feedback on the pattern itself. Furthermore, we can guarantee that this
feedback is more accurate than generic feedback meters because of the generation process.
The feedback is also based on a much stronger attacker: one who knows your pattern. Even
so, a strong password will likely stand up to their attacks.
