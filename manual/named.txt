Named

This expression references another expression in the same pattern and with the same name.
By default the '\named' expression will simply copy what the referenced expression
generated.

Example:

    '\word[name=myword]\named[name=myword]' would generate 'pancakepancake'

Arguments:

    name - The name of the referenced expression. The referenced expression should have
           this same argument with the same name, and must appear before the '\named'
           expression.
    
    reverse - Can be 'true' or 'false' to reverse what the referenced expression
              generated.
    
    regen - Can be 'true' or 'false' to regenerate the referenced expression using the
            same arguments.

Remember, the referenced expression must come before the '\named' expression.
