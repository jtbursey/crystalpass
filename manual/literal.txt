Literals

A literal is any string of characters in your pattern that is not a part of an
expression. Literals are copied directly into the generated password. As such, they to
not add any entropy to the pattern or make your password more secure. They can, however,
be fun to decorate your password.

Example:

    'my\word[]' would generate mypancake
