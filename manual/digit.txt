Digit

This expression generates a string of base ten digits.

Arguments:

    length - The number of digits to generate. (i.e. length=2 would make '12')

    set/range - The set of digits to use. This can either be denoted as a set (i.e. "12")
                or a range (i.e. 0-9). The words 'set' and 'range' are not used.

For range lengths, the length is chosen at random first, then that number of digits are
chosen at random.
